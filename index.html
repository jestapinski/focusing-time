          <h2>A productivity story built on efficiency</h2>
          <p>
            Great output is not about longer hours. It is about better focus
            design. Focusing Time helps you defend attention, reduce context
            switching, and keep energy aligned with your highest-value work.

            <h3>Focus blocks that protect deep work</h3>
            <p>
              Set precise focus intervals so your brain can settle into one
              problem at a time. You build cognitive momentum, avoid task
              thrash, and finish with cleaner attention.

            <h3>Breaks that reset without derailing you</h3>
            <p>
              Intentional breaks keep you fresh and prevent fatigue. Short,
              planned recovery windows make it easier to return to the next
              block without procrastination.
